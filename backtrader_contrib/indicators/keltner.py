    Keltner channel is a technical analysis indicator showing a central moving average line
    plus channel lines at a distance above and below.
    The indicator is named after Chester W. Keltner (1909–1998)
    who described it in his 1960 book How To Make Money in Commodities.
    This name was applied by those who heard about it from him,
    but Keltner called it the ten-day moving average trading rule
    and indeed made no claim to any originality for the idea.

    Formula:
      - midband = SimpleMovingAverage((high+low+close)/3, period)
      - topband = midband + devfactor * SimpleMovingAverage((high - low)/2, period)
      - botband = midband - devfactor * SimpleMovingAverage((high - low)/2, period)

    See:
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keltner_channel
